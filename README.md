Breakout! 

Arrow keys for single player, use the up key to shoot a projectile towards the ball. Press 2 to activate 2-player mode, use WAD to control second player. Press P to change color of the paddle and lives, so much customization to choose from! Don't let the ball hit the floor, you'll lose a life, and don't let the bottom paddle hit the red particles falling down, you'll also lose a life! Top paddle does not lose lives for a slightly easier game in 2 player. There are 3 levels, and difficulty and speed will scale as you progress. Good luck!
